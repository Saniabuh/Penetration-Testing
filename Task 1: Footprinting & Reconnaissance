In conducting this activity, a passive footprinting approach was initially adopted, using tools such as Whois, DNSdumpster, Maltego, and Netcraft 
to gather information about the targets. For the reconnaissance phase, both passive and active methods were employed. 
The tools used included Recon-ng, Nmap (Network Mapper), and Angry IP Scanner.

WHOIS

WHOIS is a protocol used to query databases that store registration details for domain names, IP addresses, and other internet resources. 
A typical WHOIS lookup returns information such as the domain registrant’s name and contact details, the domain’s registration and expiration dates, 
associated name servers, and other technical metadata.

To demonstrate the type of information WHOIS can extract about a target, a query was performed against https://cyber94.com.ng
WHOIS can be accessed through its official website or executed as a command-line tool. For this exercise, the command-line method was used, 
as shown in the screenshot below.
